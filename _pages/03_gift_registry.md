### What is this?
* A registry helps you to choose a gift for us. The wishlist has the products we think that we are going to use in the near future. Simply put, __"the gifts we like to get from you"__
* This avoids the confusion for our guests who would like give us something but just dont know what
* you can get it to the venue or send to the below address. once bought on amazon the product disapears from the wishlist. so, others know that they need not get it
* __Address:__ KRISHNA TEJA SURAPANENI, 102, Silver Springs Apartment, Oddu Gudem, koyala water plant road,PALWANCHA, 507115. phone: 9533355933

### Are you asking us to get you gifts?
* __NO__, thats not the idea. Just don't bring one if you prefer not to
* We are just glad the we were able to invite you to the wedding and hope that you will come
* This is just to make sure valuable time & money is not wasted things we are not going to use
